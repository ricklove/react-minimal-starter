# react-minimal-starter

A minimal starter for react tutorials

## Setup

- Create a new git repo on Github
- Clone the repo to a local directory
- Open the terminal to that directory
- Run Create React App into that directory
    - `yarn create react-app . --template typescript`
- Open the folder in vscode
- Remove the files in the `/src` folder
- Replace with the files in this `/src` folder
    - `index.tsx` loads react and renders the `App` component (this should not be modified)
    - `index.css` is a simple css reset to give you clean styles (this should not be modified)
    - `App.tsx` is the main app entry
- Done
    - You should end up with something identical to this repo
